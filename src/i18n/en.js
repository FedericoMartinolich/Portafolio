      description: `I have one year of experience as a web developer working at Rebrit SRL, participating in the maintenance and evolution of web applications used in real production environments.
During this period, I worked with PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, developing and maintaining both backend and frontend functionalities on an internal framework specific to the company. I performed corrective and evolutionary maintenance tasks, modifications on existing code, and improvements aimed at system stability.
I participated in systems with microservices-based architecture, collaborating in the maintenance and integration of different services, and in multi-tenant environments, adapting functionalities according to different clients or usage contexts. I implemented asynchronous communication between frontend and backend using AJAX, optimizing flows and user experience.
Additionally, I performed refactoring tasks, optimized database queries, and created technical documentation to facilitate maintenance and teamwork.
Complementarily, I develop personal projects, where I apply best practices and carry out the complete development and deployment cycle, which can be seen in my portfolio.
